## Key Equations to Learn (for phonon transport at interfaces)

### 1) Equations of motion → eigenproblem
- Newton’s law for lattice vibrations:
  $$ M\,\ddot{u}(t) = -K\,u(t) $$
- Harmonic ansatz:
  $$ u(t) = U\,e^{-i\omega t} $$
- Generalized eigenproblem (natural frequencies/modes):
  $$ (K - \omega^2 M)\,U = 0 $$
- Mass-normalized form:
  $$ D = M^{-1/2} K M^{-1/2}, \qquad D\,U = \omega^2 U, \qquad U^\top U = I $$

*Relevance to the paper:* This is the starting point; the paper’s central claim is that **the correct modes for interfacial transport are the eigenmodes of the entire interface system** (from the above eigenproblem), not the bulk modes of the isolated materials.

---

### 2) Lead dispersion (useful for band edges in 1D)
- Monatomic 1D chain with mass $m$ and spring $k$:
  $$ \omega(q) = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\,\Big|\sin\!\frac{qa}{2}\Big| $$

*Relevance to the paper:* Knowing lead band limits clarifies **where propagating vs evanescent modes live**, which affects which interface modes can actually carry energy across the junction.

---

### 3) Surface Green’s function (1D monatomic lead, closed form)
Let $z=\omega^2+i\eta$, $h_0=\tfrac{2k}{m}$, $h_1=-\tfrac{k}{m}$. The surface Green’s function $g$ solves
  $$ h_1^2\,g^2 - (z - h_0)\,g + 1 = 0, \qquad \text{choose the root with } \Im g < 0. $$

*Relevance to the paper:* Interfaces are treated by **embedding** semi-infinite leads; the self-energies below use these $g$’s, which then feed the device Green’s function used for **mode-resolved transmission**.

---

### 4) Embedding the leads (self-energies & broadenings)
- Self-energies:
  $$ \Sigma_{L}(\omega) = V_L\, g_L(\omega)\, V_L^\top, \qquad \Sigma_{R}(\omega) = V_R\, g_R(\omega)\, V_R^\top $$
- Broadening (coupling) matrices:
  $$ \Gamma_{L} = i\!\left(\Sigma_L - \Sigma_L^\dagger\right), \qquad \Gamma_{R} = i\!\left(\Sigma_R - \Sigma_R^\dagger\right) $$

*Relevance to the paper:* These capture **how the bulk leads couple into the interface region**; the paper’s mode-correction is about **what basis** you use when interpreting the transmission that results.

---

### 5) Device Green’s function (frequency domain)
  $$ G(\omega) = \Big[(\omega^2 + i\eta)I - D - \Sigma_L(\omega) - \Sigma_R(\omega)\Big]^{-1} $$

*Relevance to the paper:* $G(\omega)$ is the engine of transport; the paper emphasizes that **mode analysis should be done in the eigenbasis of the full interface system** associated with $D$, not projected onto bulk eigenmodes.

---

### 6) Transmission (Caroli formula)
  $$ T(\omega) = \mathrm{Tr}\!\Big[\Gamma_L\, G\, \Gamma_R\, G^\dagger\Big] $$

*Relevance to the paper:* This is the scalar quantity everyone reports. The paper clarifies **how to decompose $T(\omega)$ correctly into contributions of the interface’s own modes**, avoiding misinterpretation from bulk-mode projections.

---

### 7) Spectral function & density of states (diagnostics)
- Spectral function:
  $$ A(\omega) = i\!\left(G - G^\dagger\right) $$
- Local/total phonon DOS:
  $$ \rho(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\,\mathrm{Tr}\!\big[A(\omega)\big] $$

*Relevance to the paper:* Diagonalizing $A(\omega)$ (or projecting responses onto system modes $U$) lets you build **mode-resolved channels** consistent with the “correct modes” definition at the interface.

---

### 8) Landauer heat current and thermal conductance (optional but useful)
- Heat current:
  $$ J = \int_0^\infty \frac{\hbar \omega}{2\pi}\, T(\omega)\,\Big[n_B(\omega,T_L) - n_B(\omega,T_R)\Big]\, d\omega $$
  where $n_B(\omega,T)=\frac{1}{e^{\hbar\omega/k_BT}-1}$.
- Linear-response thermal conductance:
  $$ \kappa(T) = \int_0^\infty \frac{(\hbar\omega)^2}{2\pi k_B T^2}\, T(\omega)\, n_B(\omega,T)\!\left(1+n_B(\omega,T)\right)\, d\omega $$

*Relevance to the paper:* While the paper is about **mode definitions**, these relations show how improved, correctly mode-resolved $T(\omega)$ directly impacts **macroscopic thermal predictions**.

---

### 9) “Correct modes” participation at contacts (simple diagnostic)
- A handy contact-participation metric for system mode $n$:
  $$ p_n = \sum_{i \in \text{ends}} |U_{in}|^2 $$

*Relevance to the paper:* A practical way to **see which interface eigenmodes actually couple to the leads**—aligns with the paper’s message to interpret transport in terms of **interface/system modes** rather than bulk ones.

## 📚 Reading Guide: Numerical Linear Algebra for our Phonon-NEGF notebook

This sequence maps each concept we used (eigenmodes, Green’s functions as linear solves, stability, block ops, sparsity, randomized methods) to fastai’s Numerical Linear Algebra notebooks — with a quick “why this matters for NEGF” under each.

- **1. [why are we here](https://nbviewer.org/github/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra-v2/blob/master/nbs/01-Why-are-we-here.ipynb)** — overview of matrix computations, accuracy, vectorization  
      Sets intuition for why small numerical tweaks (like $i\eta$) and stable algorithms matter when solving $(\omega^2 I - D - \Sigma_L - \Sigma_R)$.

      Direct inverses of the Green’s-function matrix are numerically brittle; prefer factorizations/solves and watch conditioning.
